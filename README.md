# Play What?

This repo contains early test code for [play-what](https://github.com/dan9418/play-what), a suite of music theory software tools. This repo is longer maintained, but the Play What project is still privately developed by the owner and is on track for a formal release in early 2022.

## Future of this project

Since the publication of this experimental code in 2019, the Play What project has evolved into a more mature and thorough ecosystem of music theory tools. The final product will include a both user-facing app and extensible open-source components. Details will be published here upon initial release in 2022.
